The motion_blur.py file contains the motion blurrer object, while the generate_blurred_images.py file provides an interface for utilizing the motion_blur class in other python programs. 

The generate_inputs.ipynb provides a set of functions which, given a list of input images, will generate new names for the blurred outputs, generate the blurred outputs, and save them conveniently in a user specified folder. This pipeline greatly streamlines the generation of test inputs.
